This is a game made using jQuery and HTML5 Canvas that is inspired by my favorite flash game of all time, Balloono, which is itself an online multiplayer clone of Bomberman. I wanted to see if I could make a Balloono/Bomberman clone using HTML5's canvas.

The project is in its very early stages, so the game can be summarized as follows:

	Two squares do mortal combat using laser-emitting bombs.

Player 1 controls:

	movement: WASD
	drop a bomb: X

Player 2 controls:

	movement: PL;' (semicolon and single quote)
	drop a bomb: / (forward slash)
	
If one or both players die, the game currently prints out who died in the console and stops the game.
